Important and/or easy:
- [x] BUG Resolve scroll bug across devices, verify
- [] Update data script to run one request at a time
- [] Add data update script (used IMDb IDs for guaranteed matches)
- [] Multiple scoring systems
- [] Query string holding search values for routing purposes
- [] Link to lists within expanded details
- [] Add TV data fetch script
- [] Investigate music API options
- [] indexedDB for old lists
- [] Explanation or weighting systems
- [] Script to update data using imdb ids

Nice to have:
- [] Generate weighted decade list 
- [] Custom weighting system
- [] Only display lists containing a specific entry (e.g.if a 2019 list excluded Parasite odds are it'll be using UK release dates, which may add a lot of noise to the list)
- [] Exclude lists containing a specific entry (e.g. same as above, but also I'm not gonna trust a list that thinks Bombshell is top 10 for 2019)
