  <title>Critics Lists: Intro</title>
</svelte:head>
<div class="Landing">
	<p>This site collects data from a whole load of year end lists from over the last decade for the following purposes:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Gathering and presenting additional data than has been provided by other aggregators</li>
		<li>Allow custom rating metrics and modifications (e.g. omitting lists)</li>
		<li>Wuick searching of the listed entries (links only lead to searches on other sites, not direct links, sorry...)</li>
		<li>Make it easier for me to scroll down through it for some oddities</li>
		<li>Excuse to use Svelte kinda recklessly (I've done about 95% of this offline so been kinda guessing stuff from READMEs and the library source code)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		With respect to the data gathering, I'm mostly making it up as a go along.
		The key one I want to do is a an aggregated list of all the end of year lists to compare directly with the decade list, I also might try and weigh things in different ways (e.g. average out critics from publications with more than one list)
		As it stands there are a few metrics pulled from each list which I found interesting:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong># Unique Entries</strong> Obvious enough?</li>
		<li><strong>Highest ranked with no #</strong> Seems like a solid bet for an easy pleaser that potentially has slipped a bit under the radar? Alternatively it's just something people like to include in their list</li>
		<li><strong>Lowest ranked with a #1</strong> includes a validator for entries that only make a few lists. Not sure there's any one way to interpret this one.</li>
		<li><strong>Highest ranked pair that share no list</strong> Just a kinda cool contrast, potentially a means of signalling the biggest split in trends with mainstream critics</li>
		<li><strong>Most contrarian critic</strong> Person who's list matches up least with the overall weighted list, not sure there's anything of value from this, contains a validator for people who have totally obscure lists</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Other suggestions are extremely welcome, bear in mind that I only have access to the names and their rankings on lists here at the moment.<br/>
		Some of the data points could undoubtedly be cleaned up but I have no real interest in trying to (e.g. `(Rock list)View metal albums list (not included in combined standings)` is obviously not a critic)
	</p>

	<p>
		Lists contain a very rudimentary set of bar charts, tbh they're probably not needed or should be weighted to prevent the list being so top heavy in terms of observable data from them. I dunno.
	</p>

	<p>
		Oh, and sorry about the obnoxious marquee element on the side.
	</p>
